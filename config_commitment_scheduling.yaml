# What is commitment cost scheduling?
# - Commitment cost is the weight on the encoder loss in VQ-VAE
# - High commitment cost forces encoder to commit to discrete codes quickly
# - Low commitment cost allows encoder to explore code space more freely
# 
# Benefits of scheduling:
# 1. Start LOW (0.05): Let encoder explore and learn good representations
# 2. Gradually INCREASE: Slowly encourage commitment to discrete codes
# 3. End HIGH (1.0): Strong regularization for final stable codebook
#
# This prevents the encoder from getting stuck in bad local minima early in training
# and results in better codebook utilization and reconstruction quality.
#
# Monitor in TensorBoard: Training/Commitment_Cost shows the schedule over time
